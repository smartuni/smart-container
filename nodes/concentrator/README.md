# Concentrator Node

## Features

### Local Storage
The Concentrator Node backs up all data collected from the sensor nodes locally on an sd-card. It does this for each sensor seperatly and as soon as new data is received from the sensor.

### Data
Sensor data is timestamped (by the sensor???) and paired with gps data the concentrator node requests on arrival of the sensor data.
